So what ist done here:
- 
1. Download virtualbox image with IE11 on Windows 7 (~ 5GiB)
2. Unzip the official image from MS
3. Install virtualbox and virtualbox extensions
4. Import image to virtualbox (25-30 GiB)
5. Create snapshot
6. User: IE11 and Password: Passw0rd!
Use the snapshot to start again after 90 days trial (but if you have a working Win7 key just activate with this, ;)).

This is at the moment the best way to be shure that you are really testing on IE11.
1. Before you start just increase video memory in settings ...
