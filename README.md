So what ist done here:
- 
1. Download virtualbox image with IE11 on Windows 7 x86-32 Bit (~ 5GiB)

Or Download Win10 x86-64 Bit with Edge and IE11 from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/
2. Unzip the official image from MS
3. Install virtualbox and virtualbox extensions
4. Import image to virtualbox (~ 15-30 GiB at the start)
5. Create snapshot
6. User: IEUser and Password: Passw0rd!
7. Deleting packed and unpacked downloaded files

Use the snapshot to start again after 90 days trial (but if you have a working Win7 key just activate with this, ;)).

This is at the moment the best way to be shure that you are really testing on IE11.
1. Before you start just increase video memory in settings ...
