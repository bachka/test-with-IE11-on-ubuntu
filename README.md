So what ist done here:
- 
1. Download virtualbox image with IE11 on Windows 7 (~ 5GiB)
2. Unzip the official image from MS
3. Install virtualbox and virtualbox extensions
4. Import image to virtualbox (25-30 GiB)
5. Create snapshot
6. User: IE11 and Password: Passw0rd!
Use the snapshot to start again after 90 days trial.
This is at the moment the best way to be shure that you are really testing on IE11.
1. Before you start just increase video memory in settins ...
